A demonstration of developing demo of Explanation contnet that can be made available given a dataset to end-users or for the developers to observe achievable explanations during the Process Planning phase of the XQFD developed in Chapter 5: A methodology to develop Explanation Planning in XAI Systems. Thesis title: A user centric approach to Explainable AI in Industry
Additional methods that are an improvement or have an upgraded appraoch to ones demonstrated here can be tested using the code and usecase.
